    <h1>Pumpkin Patch</h1>
    <p>We had lots of folks in our first year ask us to plant a Pumpkin Patch so they could do some of their Halloween shopping while enjoying the Maze. That sounded like a good idea so we have started planting a patch every year. Hopefully the weather, deer, and bugs will cooperate and we will have a nice crop of pumpkins for you to pick.</p>
