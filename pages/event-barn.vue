      <h1>Wedding and Event Barn</h1>

      <p>We are happy to now offer a wedding and event barn for those looking for something a little out of the ordinary for their wedding or event.  Our barn has a capacity of 100 people.  You can increase the number of guests by adding a tent if you wish. The grounds around the barn are very expansive.  The barn will be a wonderful setting for your wedding or event and give you life-long memories.  We are taking bookings now for 2024. The barn is a “warm weather” venue so we anticipate our season will be from around the first of June until the first of October.</p>

      <p>The barn is sheeted on the outside with pine lumber logged off from our farm and the inside walls are covered with oak also logged off here on the farm.  We have done our very best to make this a real barn to give you a true “out in the country” experience.  Naturally, we have added some Irish touches and our famous Irish hospitality will be front and center at the barn.</p>

      <p>We have a room for the bride and her attendants, a room for caterers to use to get their food ready (no cooking), and a spot for the groom and his groomsmen.  There is also a bar and we furnish accessory tables for gifts and a guest book.</p>

      <p>We have also constructed a wedding arch so that you can conduct your ceremony here on the farm just a short walk from the wedding barn surrounded by the beauty of nature if you'd like.  Want to make a dramatic entrance?  Add our horse drawn wedding carriage to your big day and make it even more memorable.  We can keep the cost reasonable because we don't have to transport our horse and carriage off the farm.</p>

      <p>Our barn also makes a great place to conduct corporate and government training, hold organizational meetings, have a family reunion, host a graduation party, or do a fundraising event. Come out in the fall when our corn maze, pumpkin patch, and horse drawn wagon rides are in full swing for an unforgettable employee picnic or appreciation day.  </p>
      <h2>Food and Catering</h2>
      <p>We have a list of local caterers that you can select from and design your event menu however you like.  We do not receive any money from these caterers but have selected them because of their reputations for reliability and quality.  We don't want to see your event ruined by a caterer who doesn't show up or fails to provide a quality meal and service.  You do have the option to provide your own caterer we just ask to have the name in advance so we can be sure they are reputable.</p>
      <h2>Music and Entertainment</h2>
      <p>The responsibility of arranging the music and entertainment falls on your shoulders. It's up to you to decide what kind of atmosphere you want to create for your guests. Whether you choose live music, a DJ, or a playlist, make sure it's something that will keep your guests entertained. Remember, the right choice of music and entertainment can make or break your event.</p>
      <h2>Alcohol</h2>
      <p>Alcohol is permitted on the premises however it can not be sold without a special one day State liquor license.  This is only required if you are going to have a cash bar.  The purchase of beer, wine and spirits is the responsibility of the person booking the barn.  We require the use of a TIPS certified bartender.  TIPS is the State of Michigan approved training program required of all people who serve alcohol.  We have a list of bartenders who meet the criteria you can choose from if you don't have a person who is TIPS trained.  Bookings that will be providing alcohol must obtain a one day liquor liability insurance policy for the event.  These policies are available from a variety of insurance agencies.</p>

      <hr>

      <p>We have kept our pricing reasonable so that you can have a wonderful experience without breaking the bank.  We also only book one wedding a weekend so the barn will be available from Friday evening till Sunday at Noon to those who book it.  We also have a small pavilion with picnic tables and grill area that you may utilize if you wish free of charge.  It makes a nice spot for a low key rehearsal dinner or just relaxing after decorating for your wedding.</p>
      <p>Give us a call and arrange a tour of our barn and see for yourself what we have to offer.  We love visitors and showing off our property even if  you don't book with us.  The best way to get in touch is by calling or texting us at 231-580-1463.  You can also email us at <a href="mailto:fourgreenfieldsman@yahoo.com">fourgreenfieldsman@yahoo.com</a> </p>

        This is a country setting so we aren't equipped for Divas or Bridezillas.  They need to go to places that charge at least 3 times as much as us.  We are here for nice people who love the country life and hospitality and don't have an unlimited budget.
